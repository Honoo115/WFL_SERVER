# Express Boilerplate!

This is a boilerplate project used for starting new projects!

## Set up

Complete the following steps to start a new project (NEW-PROJECT-NAME):

1. Clone this repository to your local machine `git clone BOILERPLATE-URL NEW-PROJECTS-NAME`
2. `cd` into the cloned repository
3. Make a fresh start of the git history for this project with `rm -rf .git && git init`
4. Install the node dependencies `npm install`
5. Move the example Environment file to `.env` that will be ignored by git and read by the express server `mv example.env .env`
6. Edit the contents of the `package.json` to use NEW-PROJECT-NAME instead of `"name": "express-boilerplate",`

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`

Start nodemon for the application `npm run dev`

Run the tests `npm test`

## Deploying

When your new project is ready for deployment, add a new Heroku application with `heroku create`. This will make a new git remote called "heroku" and you can then `npm run deploy` which will push to this remote's master branch.


CREATE TABLE polls (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  uuid UUID NOT NULL,
  restaurants ARRAY,
  start_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  end_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() + interval '5 minutes', 
  city STRING,
  zip INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE votes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  poll_id UUID REFERENCES polls(uuid) NOT NULL ON DELETE CASCADE, 
  restaurant_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_time TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  user_ip TEXT 
);
